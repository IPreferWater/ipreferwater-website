![example timetable](/blog/timetable/example.webp)

When I travel I like to check for different places to do sport but the timetable is often inconvenient

it's a big **JPEG** file wich you can't **copy/paste** text, and it can become difficult when it's not your main language

*example of the problem*
![example timetable japanese](/blog/timetable/example_japanese.webp)

I made a simple **timetable** for this case with all the info I like to find when I look for a place to train.

* full text timetable copy-pastable
* direct link to the area in googlemap
* possibility to switch language
* index of the addresses of facility

*If you have a gym and would like to have a page in this style, send me an [email](mailto:ipreferwater2@gmail.com) and I will add it to this page*

You can check [an example](/timetable/pantheres-lille) here
