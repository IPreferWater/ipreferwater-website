# The discovery

My wife love libanese/egyptian food and of course, the falafels.
It's a quite long recipe *(soaking chickpeas, mixing, fresh ingredients, deep-fry ...)* so she prefered buy **premix**, just need water, heat and it's ready

![premix](/blog/falafel/premix.webp)

the problem is the ratio ingredients/prices
- chickpeas 30%
- bread crums 
- wheat semolina
- sugar, salt, sunflower oil, arsnip, rice flour ...

18,33€/kg for around 55% of bread ... 


# The recipe

we will change the ratio to 2 portion of chikpea for 1 for breadcrumb

### Ingredients
- breadcrumb
- chikpea flour
- all the spices you want
- sesame seed

### Breadcrumb

Store your bread in a box once he is really dry (otherwise he can become moldy )

For our preparation, place it inside a mixer to obtain your prefered texture (**thin** for **compact** falafel or **bigger** for more **airy**)

If you don't have a mixer, just place the bread in a tissu and smash it with a hammer ... work fantastic

### The Falafel

Place 2 cup of chickpea flour with 1 cup of breadcrum in a bowl and repeat for the desired proportion

once you obtain this texture it's time to cover your mix and let it rest for 5 minute

take a small portion in your wet hand

roll it to obtain a nice ball

roll the ball in a small bowl wich contain the sesame seeds, it will help to don't stick in the hoaven

place the falafel 15-20 min in the pre-heat hoven at 180°
once you can put a knife in the falafel and it's clean, you can get them off !

*example with peanut, pumpkin, rice & homemade mayo*

we roughlty divided the price by 2 (bio chickpea flour is at 8,20€/kg ), and put only the spices we wanted !
