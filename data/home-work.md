### BONJOUR

It's been a long time since I made a new article, I had a new freelance mission from **March** to **September**

So, if you are reading this, it's either because you are curious about what I did during **September** to **November** 2023 or you are my **mum** ( the only person interested in my posts)

## Context

![house](/blog/home-work/presentation.webp)

My house is the **white one**, the bottom (**red square**) belong to the abandoned house.
I don't know why/when they splitted it, I just bought it like this ...

*I recently meet people that visited the house before us, and they didn't buy as they considered this a red flag*

![hole](/blog/home-work/hole.webp)

The problem was the common part (roof) from the haunted house was **really bad**, you could see the wood of my 1st floor because of the  holes


![temperature](/blog/home-work/temperature.webp)
This lead to have nice clim during **summer**, and terrible cold during **winter**

At worst, we had **11°** in the house and **3°** at the parquet level ...


So I contacted the owner ( a realstate company ) if I could buy the abandoned house and for historic reason I was able to obtain only the red-square part

It tooks **only 2 years**, becoming a falicitator for geometry / notary / real-estate / contacting neighbourhood, the real estate agent was redialed with a **thank you bye** letter from his boss for his wonderfull work

As a **total noob** in using my hands somewhere else than a keyboard, I will be accompagned with my father in the process. All the decisions was made based on his experience and civil engineering ref I could find on internet

# Start

## ceiling
*Note at this step I was uncertain I could buy the small-part, they just agreed to let me put isolation on the ceiling to fight the winter*

![plafond](/blog/home-work/plafond.webp)

- remove the cob, wood and nails
- put fixations at the same levels using the laser
- first, 20cm of glass wool
- tie with rope


![plafond_with_isolation](/blog/home-work/plafond_with_isolation.webp)

- put aluminium rail to accept ceiling
- add another big 40cm of wood wool

![plafond_finished](/blog/home-work/plafond_finished.webp)
- put OBS to proctect the job done

### notes
- I choosed  **wood wool** for ecological reason, it was horrible to cut. You have to compress the area with clamp and saw carrefully to cut the wool. The material is rigid and really hard to place behind the rails. It also spread a lot of particules, great for your lungs
- I used a **plate lifter** for the obs, I have no idea how it is possible to do without

## the wall

After 2 years of negociating, we had an **agreement** with the owner ! Fantastic ! in the condition I build the wall of separation between my new little area and the abandonned house.

To proove I'm wiling to do it, they just want a **paper with an estimation of a mason**

Problem, absolutely nobody want to do the job, it's to small for them.

So let's see how to do a nice wall

*When I gave them the paper from the only maçon that agreed to come, they finaly asked me to give them 2 papers, one for the inside wall & for the outside. I asked them if they needed a paper for each block of concrete and they gave up their new brillant idea*

![dig foundation](/blog/home-work/dig_foundation.webp)

For the **foundation**
- I digued 50cm
- placed a thin layer of concrete
-  first 2 rows of concrete block

![floor](/blog/home-work/floor.webp)

once I put the 2nd row, I made the floor before the wall would be too tall, I did my best to make it at the **same level** of my current house

![wall](/blog/home-work/wall.webp)

Then **each weeks**, add 3 rows of concretes, and let it dry for the next week

![dig wall](/blog/home-work/dig_wall.webp)

now the wall is **too hight** to access the oposite side, I need to dig an access from inside my house.

*It need to be **tight** because this is the sewing workshop of my wife ...*

### notes
- we used a rope to ensure the wall is straight, the concrete block need to be placed above the rope so it has to be placed with fingertip

- at the begining, the pain was in the **back** because of the low working position

- at the middle, in the **fingers** because you need to put the concrete above the rope *"DONT TOUCH THE ROPES STUPID SON"* but be able

- at the end, in both because of the impossible position

*was definitly the most physical part, not enjoyable, would not recomend*

## inside

![wall break](/blog/home-work/wall_break.webp)

- finish to open the wall
- throw all the **red bricks** on the other side ( you can see on the 2nd picture the wall was not totally closed)
- even it was not a **"bearer wall"** with old house it can become "semi-bearer", I put some props for safety and will add a wooden beam for peace of mind
- even the new **edges** with cement

![tiles](/blog/home-work/tiles.webp)

I found second-hand grey tiles for only **3€/square²** , thanks again to my little sister that drove me to get them

![slope](/blog/home-work/slope.webp)

they were still a big difference of level between the house and the new space ... I did the smoothest slope I could

![tiles slope finished](/blog/home-work/tiles_slope_finished.webp)

at this step, I'm sad to say the smartphone of my wife **died** ( my wife still alive, even sadder) ... with all the last pictures I took

please use your imagination for the rest

- add wood structure
- insert **4cm** of wood wool inside part( sound isolation ) and **20cm** for the little part that is exposed to outside
- apply **plywood** pannel
- add **placo** for the part too damaged to set wood
- make the **skirting board** for top & bottom (I used the leftover of plywood and a bosh flusher)
- set up **electricity**

And here is the result

![ceiling finished](/blog/home-work/ceiling_finished.webp)


My father woke up nearly everydays with me, **6am** to walk the dog and **7am** at my house ready to sweat

He was involved **every steps** I showed you and much more I didn't show like mooving 100 concrete blocks, picking and throwing waste at the recycling center, finding fantastic cheap wood at 120km, bringing all his personal items ect ect ...

He is **65 years old** but has the strenght of an ape

**Thank you** for showing and teaching how to advance, also for forcing me to go back to school so I have a job on a chair ...
